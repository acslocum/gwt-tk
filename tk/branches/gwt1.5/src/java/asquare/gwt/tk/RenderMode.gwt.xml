<module>
	<!-- 
	  Determines whether the document is being rendered in Strict Mode 
	  (Standards Compliance Mode) or Quirks Mode. 
	  
	  Falls back on "CSS1Compat" if rendering mode cannot be determined. 
	  
	  In general: 
	  (Strict DTD | XHTML) -> Strict Mode -> CSS1Compat
	  (Transitional DTD | no DTD) -> Quirks Mode -> BackCompat
	  
	  This property is not available in Safari as of v2.0.4, however Safari does
	  have two render modes. 
	  
	  For more info see:
